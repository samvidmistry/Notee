A project where I try to make a good android app architecture which is easily Unit and Instrumentation testable by following MVP
pattern, while I'm also trying to incorporate android-priority-jobqueue from yigit so that application can always run its jobs.
Also trying to make the architecture in a way it can handle offline work whenever required.
